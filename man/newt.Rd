\item{ Field }{ Intended electrical field strength as a multiple of the natural strength, which is Field=1.  This distinguishes the 5 groups of subjects. }
\item{ FieldExp }{ Measured field strength in the experimental  (field applied) and control (natural) This is a check on how well the experimenters succeeded in imposing the  conditions they aimed for in groups other than 1.  In group 1,  we see natural limb-to-limb variation. }
\item{ FieldCtrl }{ Measured field strength in the experimental  (field applied) and control (natural) This is a check on how well the experimenters succeeded in imposing the  conditions they aimed for in groups other than 1.  In group 1,  we see natural limb-to-limb variation. }
\item{ RateExp }{ Healing rates (micrometers per hour) in the experimental limbs.  This is the response variable. }
\item{ RateCtrl }{ Healing rates (micrometers per hour) in the control limbs.  This is the response variable. }

\details{
Data provided by Drina Iglesia, Purdue University.  The data are part of a larger study reported in D. D. S. Iglesia, E. J. Cragoe, Jr., and J. W. Vanable, ``Electric field strength and epithelization in the newt (Notophthalmus viridescens),'' Journal of Experimental Zoology, 274 (1996), pp.\ 56--62.
Data on healing of cuts in newts under several conditions of applied electric field.  See Exercise 24.33 for a description of the experiment.  Table 24.5 contains partial data.  Here are the full data.
