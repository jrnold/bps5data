\details{
Local telephone companies must provide repair service for customers of other telephone companies who lease their lines.  The local company is called the ILEC (Incumbent Local Exchange Carrier).  Competing companies are CLECs (Competing Local Exchange Carriers).  The data are a random sample of 1687 repair times (hours) from areas in which Verizon is the ILEC.  Of these, 1664 are Verizon's own customers (ILEC) and 23 are customers of other companies (CLEC). The distributions of repair times are strongly skewed.
