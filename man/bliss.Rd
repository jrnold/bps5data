\details{
Data from Orit Hetzroni, The Effects of Active Versus Passive Computer-Assisted Instruction on the Acquisition, Retention, and Generalization of Blissymbols While Using Elements for Teaching Compounds, Ph.D. thesis, Purdue University, 1995. The thesis concerns computer-aided instruction (CAI) in the use of ``Blissymbols'' for communication.  These symbols are used in teaching special groups of students.  Normal-ability school children were randomly assigned to treatment groups.  The part of the data in the file concerns four groups in a randomized factorial 2 by 2 design.
\tabular{lll}{
       \tab Active  \tab Passive \cr
Before \tab        I   \tab II \cr During \tab       III   \tab IV }
The two factors are the learning style (active or passive) of the CAI lesson and the placement of the material to be learned (Blissymbol elements before compounds or elements and compounds during a joint presentation).  We expect active learning to be more successful than passive.  We have no expectation about the effect of placement.  Each subject was tested immediately after the lesson, one week later, and three weeks later.  There are thus three repeated measures for each subject.
