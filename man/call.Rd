\details{
Data provided by Larry Brown and Haipeng Shen, from Haipeng Shen, Nonparametric Regression for Problems Involving Lognormal Distributions, Ph.D. thesis, University of Pennsylvania, 2003. These are talk times (seconds) for the 31,492 customer calls handled by the customer service call center of a small bank in a month.  The distribution of service times is strongly right-skewed.  Data analysis shows interesting effects.  There are quite a few very short service times (say, less than 10 seconds).  Short calls are mostly due to agents hanging up on the customer in order to reduce their average talk time and increase the count of calls handled -- these are (flawed) measures of the agents' performance.  The extreme right tail shows 13 times over an hour, one almost 8 hours.  The reason is not known, though equipment malfunction is possible.
