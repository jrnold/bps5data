      Data from Orit Hetzroni, The Effects of Active Versus Passive
      Computer-Assisted Instruction on the Acquisition, Retention, and
      Generalization of Blissymbols While Using Elements for Teaching
      Compounds, Ph.D. thesis, Purdue University, 1995.
      The thesis concerns computer-aided instruction (CAI) in the use of
      ``Blissymbols'' for communication.  These symbols are used in teaching
      special groups of students.  Normal-ability school children were
      randomly assigned to treatment groups.  The part of the data in the
      file concerns four groups in a randomized factorial 2 by 2 design.

      \tabular{lll}{
             \tab Active  \tab Passive \cr
      Before \tab        I   \tab II \cr
      During \tab       III   \tab IV
      }

      The two factors are the learning style (active or passive) of the CAI
      lesson and the placement of the material to be learned (Blissymbol
      elements before compounds or elements and compounds during a joint
      presentation).  We expect active learning to be more successful than
      passive.  We have no expectation about the effect of placement.  Each
      subject was tested immediately after the lesson, one week later, and
      three weeks later.  There are thus three repeated measures for each
      subject.

    Data provided by Larry Brown and Haipeng Shen, from Haipeng Shen,
    Nonparametric Regression for Problems Involving Lognormal
    Distributions, Ph.D. thesis, University of Pennsylvania, 2003.
    These are talk times (seconds) for the 31,492 customer calls handled by
    the customer service call center of a small bank in a month.  The
    distribution of service times is strongly right-skewed.  Data analysis
    shows interesting effects.  There are quite a few very short service
    times (say, less than 10 seconds).  Short calls are mostly due to
    agents hanging up on the customer in order to reduce their average talk
    time and increase the count of calls handled -- these are (flawed)
    measures of the agents' performance.  The extreme right tail shows
    13 times over an hour, one almost 8 hours.  The reason is not
    known, though equipment malfunction is possible.
